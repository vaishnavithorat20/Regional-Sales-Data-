Welcome to my end-to-end data analysis and dashboard project focused on U.S. regional sales performance.
This project was built using raw CSV datasets, modeled in a star schema, and visualized using Power BI. It aims to uncover insights that can drive real business decisions around product sales, regional performance, and customer demographics.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This dashboard was designed to explore and answer key business questions such as:

âœ… How do actual sales compare with budgets across products and regions?
âœ… Which customer segments (based on location and income) perform better?
âœ… What are the trends over months, quarters, and years?
âœ… How do different regions perform based on household income and outlet delivery?
âœ… What is the contribution of each product category and sales outlet?

ðŸ§° Tech Stack Used
Power BI Desktop â€“ for visualization & dashboard development
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ for calculated columns & dynamic KPIs
CSV Data Sources â€“ for building the data model
Star Schema â€“ to ensure clean relationships and optimized queries

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts Demonstrated

Data modeling using Power BI relationships
Time-based analysis using a custom Date table
Designing KPIs like Total Sales, Budget, Line Total, and Order Quantity
Building slicers and filters for better interactivity
Geographic visualizations (state-wise breakdowns, income heatmaps, etc.)
Creating a reusable, real-world-ready business intelligence solution
